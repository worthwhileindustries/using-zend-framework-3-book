# Preface

"Using Zend Framework 3" is a free and open-source book about programming 
web applications with Zend Framework 3. 

## About this Book

"Using Zend Framework 3" book is a free and open-source book about creating 
websites with Zend Framework 3. 
This book uses [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/) license. 

ZF3 is a modern PHP framework 
intended for building professional, scalable and secure websites. 
Such websites are easy to test and maintain. The framework utilizes the best 
practices and common design patterns inspired by the evolution of the web development 
industry. This includes the *Model-View-Controller* pattern allowing an application's code to be organized in a consistent and standard way.

This book is not only about Zend Framework, but also about closely related 
libraries. Although Zend Framework 3 has a dedicated component for accessing the 
database, in this book we use a third-party library called Doctrine ORM which is a de-facto 
standard object-oriented way to perform database management. In the sample applications we will create in chapters of this 
book, Twitter Bootstrap CSS Framework is used to produce nicely styled and laid out web pages.

## Intended Audience

This book is intended for web developers involved in the development of web-based applications in PHP.
The author strives to start with simple things that a beginner should 
understand. Advanced things go last in a chapter. This makes this book the first book about Zend 
Framework that is easy to read and understand for a newbie.
You do not need to be a guru in design patterns to understand most of the content.

To read and understand this book, you need to have a basic knowledge of PHP.
A good point for learning PHP is [its official website](http://php.net/) and the on-line 
[documentation](http://php.net/docs.php). It would be good if you have some understanding of HTTP requests, GET and POST variables, namespaces, classes and interfaces. 

Because PHP is closely related to other web technologies, it is also recommended that
you have some basic experience in the following: 

 * HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) -- used for creating web pages that 
   can be displayed in a web browser. 
 * CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) -- used for defining the look and feel 
   of a web page, like font size or background color.
 * JavaScript -- a client-side scripting language used for making a web 
   page more interactive.

For learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript, a good starting point is 
[W3Schools Tutorials](http://www.w3schools.com/).
